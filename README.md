## Overview
This repository provides a framework for building RESTful APIs. It aims to simplify the development process while ensuring best practices in API design. The API supports various features, including user authentication, data validation, and error handling.

## Getting Started
To get started, visit [GitHub](https://github.com). You can find detailed instructions on how to set up the API locally. This will help you understand the structure and functionality of the codebase.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd api
   ```
3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To run the API locally, execute the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Example Request
You can test the API using tools like Postman or curl. Here‚Äôs an example of a GET request:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/resource
```

## API Endpoints
The API provides several endpoints for different functionalities. Here‚Äôs a brief overview:

- **GET /api/v1/resource**: Retrieve a list of resources.
- **POST /api/v1/resource**: Create a new resource.
- **GET /api/v1/resource/:id**: Retrieve a specific resource by ID.
- **PUT /api/v1/resource/:id**: Update a specific resource by ID.
- **DELETE /api/v1/resource/:id**: Delete a specific resource by ID.

## Authentication
This API supports token-based authentication. To access protected routes, you must include a valid token in the request headers.

### Obtaining a Token
To obtain a token, send a POST request to the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint with your credentials.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login -d '{"username": "yourusername", "password": "yourpassword"}'
```

### Using the Token
Include the token in the headers of your requests as follows:
```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
```

## Error Handling
The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure. Here are some common responses:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: A new resource was created.
- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource was not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred.

## Testing
The API includes a suite of tests to ensure functionality. To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test
```
Make sure you have all dependencies installed before running tests.
